# OPEC
OPEC game as a Venezuela
We want to maximize the total profit with certain linear constriants.

Given Qd=90000-450P+epsilon
Qs=32400-120P+epsilon

Let matrix Q = [q1,q2,q3,q4,q5,q6,q7] be the production quantity decided by each of the OPEC countries.
matrix MC=[mc1,mc2,mc3,mc4,mc5,mc6,mc7] be the Marginal Cost of each country, which is constant from the OPEC.xls

Profit=sum(Q)*P-Q(transpose)*MC
